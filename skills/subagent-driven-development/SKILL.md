# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first, then code quality review.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration

## When to Use

**Use this skill when:**
- Have implementation plan
- Tasks are mostly independent
- Want to stay in this session (no context switch)

**vs. Executing Plans (batch execution):**
- Same session (no context switch)
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Two-stage review after each task: spec compliance first, then code quality
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

## The Process

1. **Read plan, extract all tasks with full text, note context, create task tracking**

2. **Per Task:**
   - Dispatch implementer subagent with full task text + context
   - Implementer asks questions? Answer them, then let them proceed
   - Implementer implements, tests, commits, self-reviews
   - Dispatch spec reviewer subagent
   - Spec reviewer confirms code matches spec? If no, implementer fixes, re-review
   - Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent
   - Code quality reviewer approves? If no, implementer fixes, re-review
   - Mark task complete

3. **After all tasks:**
   - Dispatch final code reviewer for entire implementation
   - Use finishing-a-development-branch skill

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Read plan file once: docs/plans/feature-plan.md]
[Extract all 5 tasks with full text and context]
[Create task tracking with all tasks]

Task 1: Hook installation script

[Get Task 1 text and context (already extracted)]
[Dispatch implementation subagent with full task text + context]

Implementer: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.config/superpowers/hooks/)"

Implementer: "Got it. Implementing now..."
[Later] Implementer:
  - Implemented install-hook command
  - Added tests, 5/5 passing
  - Self-review: Found I missed --force flag, added it
  - Committed

[Dispatch spec compliance reviewer]
Spec reviewer: ✅ Spec compliant - all requirements met, nothing extra

[Get git SHAs, dispatch code quality reviewer]
Code reviewer: Strengths: Good test coverage, clean. Issues: None. Approved.

[Mark Task 1 complete]

Task 2: Recovery modes
... (continues)

[After all tasks]
[Dispatch final code-reviewer]
Final reviewer: All requirements met, ready to merge

Done!
```

## Advantages

**vs. Manual execution:**
- Subagents follow TDD naturally
- Fresh context per task (no confusion)
- Parallel-safe (subagents don't interfere)
- Subagent can ask questions (before AND during work)

**Quality gates:**
- Self-review catches issues before handoff
- Two-stage review: spec compliance, then code quality
- Review loops ensure fixes actually work
- Spec compliance prevents over/under-building
- Code quality ensures implementation is well-built

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip reviews (spec compliance OR code quality)
- Proceed with unfixed issues
- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- Make subagent read plan file (provide full text instead)
- Skip scene-setting context (subagent needs to understand where task fits)
- Ignore subagent questions (answer before letting them proceed)
- **Start code quality review before spec compliance is ✅** (wrong order)
- Move to next task while either review has open issues

**If subagent asks questions:**
- Answer clearly and completely
- Provide additional context if needed
- Don't rush them into implementation

**If reviewer finds issues:**
- Implementer (same subagent) fixes them
- Reviewer reviews again
- Repeat until approved
- Don't skip the re-review

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **requesting-code-review** - Code review template for reviewer subagents
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks

**Subagents should use:**
- **test-driven-development** - Subagents follow TDD for each task

**Alternative workflow:**
- **executing-plans** - Use for batch execution instead of same-session execution
